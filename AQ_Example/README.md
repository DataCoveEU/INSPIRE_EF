This is an example of an INSPIRE Environmental Monitoring Facility measuring air. 
In this example, the EnvironmentalMonitoringFacility featureType is utilized at two levels:
* On the top level representing the Monitoring Station
* On the lower level representing two Sampling Points, one measuring Ozone while the other measures Sulfer Dioxide.

For each pollutant, a Sample utilizing the SF_SpatialSamplingFeature featureType, a Process utilizing the INSPIRE Process featureType and an O&M Observation have been provided.

The following diagram provides an overview of the featureTypes provided and their interlinkage. All XML examples are linked within the example Git Folder.
