This is an example of an INSPIRE Environmental Monitoring Facility measuring air. 
In this example, the EnvironmentalMonitoringFacility featureType is utilized at two levels:
* On the top level representing the Monitoring Station
* On the lower level representing two Sampling Points, one measuring Ozone while the other measures Sulfer Dioxide.

For each pollutant, a Sample based on the SF_SpatialSamplingFeature featureType has been provided, as well as a Process based on the INSPIRE Process featureType.
